I just made some iced latte. I actually didn't make the coffee myself because we don't have a coffee machine but Helgi went to the coffee shop close by and bought some espresso shots so I was able to make some iced coffee because I feel like you need some coffee to pair when you have some pastry. Helgi wanted me to have half of it and I'm really excited to try it because it looks really good and I'm gonna finish this book that I bought I swear like last week. I don't know I've been so fast at reading so it's called August Blue by Debra Levy and I only have a couple of pages left so I'm gonna finish it and I will tell you guys my thoughts when I'm done. So overall I enjoyed this book and I'm really happy that I picked this one out because it definitely helped me get out of my reading slump. I don't know I got sucked into it right away.
